Hi!
<br>
<br>
I'm a former live sound engineer & projects manager in a big audio rental company. I still like music a lot, but my job drifted so far from it that it didn't make sense anymore ðŸ˜”. 

During the first lockdown I discovered web developement and got crazy interrested. Like if my brain was waking up again after several years of sleep. it reminded me how much I like learning. 

I have finished Le Wagon Paris's Ruby On Rails fullstack Bootcamp in December 2021 and joined <a href='https://github.com/pennylane-hq'>Pennylane</a> as a junior software engineer (Feb 2022). Got medior full stack in July 2023, and still enjoying a lot in this company.

<a href='https://github.com/GregLaBelette/PregWheel'>PregWheel</a> is my first shot at Vanilla JS in march 2021, developed with my (patient ðŸ’•) midwife of a spouse.<br>
<a href='https://gregoirevallette.com'>gregoirevallette.com</a> is a little online resume and portfolio.
