Hi!
<br>
<br>
I'm a former live sound engineer & projects manager in a big audio rental company. I still like music a lot, but had gotten so far of it in my job and it didn't make sense anymore 😔. 

During the first lockdown I discovered web developement and got really interrested. Like if my brain was waking up again after several years of sleep. it reminded me how much I like learning. 

I have just finished Le Wagon Paris's Ruby On Rails fullstack Bootcamp (in December 2021).

<a href='https://github.com/GregLaBelette/PregWheel'>PregWheel</a> is my first shot at Vanilla JS in march 2021, developed with my (patient 💕) midwife of a spouse.<br>
<a href='https://gregoirevallette.com'>gregoirevallette.com</a> is a little online resume and portfolio.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
 <br>
 <br>
 - Practising Ruby and Rails by finishing two projects started @Le wagon: Memomix & MadPigeons. <br>
 - Finishing a first ExpressJS project called 'The Pedal Shop'. Cool discovery of Express & MongoDB 👍🏻 <br>
 - Seeking for a first dev experience in the great big world 😊 <br>
